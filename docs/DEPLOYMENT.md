# Deployment guide

## Prerequisites

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB (each Celery worker holds ~2.5 GB of model) |
| Disk | 20 GB | 50 GB+ (corpus, embeddings, model weights) |
| GPU | none | any CUDA card — cuts embedding time ~10× |
| Docker | 24+ with Compose v2 | |

A GPU is optional. On CPU, embedding the seed corpus (~650 chunks) takes a few
minutes; a full national corpus takes hours and should run on GPU or overnight.

---

## 1. Quick start (Docker)

```bash
cd uzlex-ai
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — at minimum:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=<python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))">
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<something strong>
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build downloads the embedding and reranker weights into the image
(~2.5 GB) so the first request after deploy is not a multi-minute cold start.
Skip with `--build-arg PREFETCH_MODELS=false` if you prefer a lazy first load.

Check it came up:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/health | python -m json.tool
```

`corpus.chunks` will be `0` — the index is empty until you load it.

---

## 2. Load the corpus

### Option A — pre-structured CSV (fastest, recommended first)

Instant, deterministic, and gives you a real index to evaluate retrieval
against before pointing anything at lex.uz.

```bash
docker compose exec backend python -m scripts.bootstrap \
  --admin admin@yourfirm.uz \
  --seed-csv-dir /app/data/seed
```

Place your CSVs in `backend/data/seed/` first (the compose file mounts
`./backend/data` into the container). The loader auto-detects two layouts:

| Layout | Columns |
|---|---|
| `jinoyat` | `Qism, Bo'lim, Bob raqami, Bob nomi, Modda raqami, Modda nomi, Modda matni` |
| `konstitutsiya` | `modda_raqami, bolim, bob_raqami, bob_nomi, matn` |

Anything else: pass an explicit `ColumnMap` (see `services/ingestion/seed_csv.py`).

### Option B — crawl lex.uz

**Read the legal note in §6 before running this against production.**

```bash
docker compose exec backend python -m scripts.bootstrap \
  --seed-lexuz --languages uz-Latn,ru --limit 20
```

Or asynchronously via the API (requires an admin token):

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/ingest/async \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"connector":"lexuz","seeds":true,"languages":["uz-Latn","ru"]}'
```

Watch progress:

```bash
docker compose logs -f worker
curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/ingest/runs -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### Verify

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/laws/stats | python -m json.tool
```

Then sanity-check retrieval before trusting any answer:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"shartnoma shakli","top_k":5}' | python -m json.tool
```

---

## 3. Bulk-import performance

For an import larger than ~100k chunks, drop the HNSW index first — building it
incrementally during insert is roughly 10× slower than building it once at the
end.

```sql
-- before the import
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS ix_chunk_embedding_hnsw;

-- after
SET maintenance_work_mem = '2GB';
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 4;
CREATE INDEX ix_chunk_embedding_hnsw ON chunks
  USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
ANALYZE chunks;
```

Recall/latency tuning at query time:

```sql
SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;  -- default 40; higher = better recall, slower
```

---

## 4. Switching models

### LLM provider

Switch globally in `.env` (`LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic|openai|ollama`) or per
request via the `provider` field on `/chat`. No restart needed for the
per-request form.

For the local/air-gapped profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile local-llm up -d ollama
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

Then set `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`. The provider raises `num_ctx` to 8192 — the
Ollama default of 2048 would silently truncate the retrieved statutes, which is
the most dangerous failure mode in this system.

### Embedding model

⚠️ **Changing `EMBEDDING_MODEL` requires a full reindex.** Vectors from
different models are not comparable, so a model change without a reindex
degrades retrieval silently rather than failing loudly.

```bash
# update EMBEDDING_MODEL and EMBEDDING_DIM in .env, then:
docker compose restart backend worker
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/reindex -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

If the new model has a different dimension, also alter the column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE chunks DROP COLUMN embedding;
ALTER TABLE chunks ADD COLUMN embedding vector(<new_dim>);
-- then recreate the HNSW index as in §3
```

## 5. Scheduled sync

Celery beat is configured out of the box (`app/workers/celery_app.py`):

| Job | Schedule (Asia/Tashkent) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sync-lexuz-daily` | 03:00 | Re-check seeded codes; content hashing makes unchanged acts nearly free |
| `discover-new-acts-weekly` | Sun 04:00 | Crawl for newly published acts |
| `connector-selfcheck-daily` | 06:30 | **Detects a lex.uz layout change before it empties the corpus** |
| `resolve-crossrefs-daily` | 05:00 | Resolve references whose target act arrived later |
| `prune-logs-weekly` | Mon 02:00 | Retention on query logs (365 days) |

The self-check job matters more than it looks: scraping degrades silently when
markup changes, and an empty corpus produces "no sources found" rather than an
error. Alert on `connector_selfcheck_task` returning `ok: false`.

---

## 6. Legal and operational obligations

**Before crawling lex.uz in production:**

- lex.uz is the state legal database. Confirm the terms of use, and for
  sustained crawling seek written permission from the Ministry of Justice.
  If you have an access agreement, set `LEXUZ_API_BASE` — the API path is used
  in preference to scraping.
- Keep `respect_robots=True` and the default 2 req/s. Do not raise these to go
  faster; the connectors are polite by design.
- Set `INGEST_USER_AGENT` to identify your organisation with a real contact.

**norma.uz is a commercial publisher.** Much of its content is subscription-only.
Confirm your licence covers derivative indexing before enabling that connector.
Everything from it is typed `COMMENTARY` and is never presented as binding law.

**Compliance features already built in:**

- Every interaction is written to `query_logs` (query, citations, provider,
  latency, refusal reason) — inspect at `/api/v1/admin/logs`.
- The disclaimer is returned with every answer in the user's language and
  rendered in the UI.
- Uploaded documents are stored under `UPLOAD_DIR`; set a retention policy
  appropriate to your jurisdiction and client-confidentiality obligations.

## 7. Production hardening

```bash
docker compose --profile prod up -d   # adds nginx
```

Checklist:

- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` from a secrets manager, not `.env` on disk
- [ ] `ENV=prod`, `DEBUG=false`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS` restricted to your real domain
- [ ] TLS terminated at nginx or a load balancer (add `certbot` or an ALB)
- [ ] Postgres on managed storage with PITR; `pg_dump` alone loses the WAL
- [ ] `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` rotated off the default
- [ ] Rate limits reviewed (`RATE_LIMIT_ANON_PER_HOUR`, `..._USER_PER_HOUR`)
- [ ] Backups: `docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U uzlex uzlex | gzip > backup.sql.gz`

**nginx must not buffer `/api/`** — the supplied config disables
`proxy_buffering` there. With buffering on, SSE answers arrive all at once when
generation completes, which defeats streaming entirely.

---

## 8. Local development (no Docker)

```bash
# infrastructure only
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# worker (separate shell)
celery -A app.workers.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info

# frontend (separate shell)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Run the tests — they need no database or network:

```bash
cd backend && pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` shows `corpus.chunks: 0` | No corpus loaded | Run the bootstrap script (§2) |
| Answers always "no provisions found" | Empty index, or embeddings missing | Check `corpus.embedded_chunks`; run `/admin/reindex` |
| Keyword search returns nothing, dense works | `search_vector` not populated | Re-run ingestion; the tsvector is written in SQL after chunk insert |
| Uzbek queries miss obvious articles | Script mismatch | Confirm `script_variants` is applied — both scripts must be searched |
| Ingestion succeeds but acts are empty | lex.uz markup changed | `GET /admin/connectors/health` → check `selectors`; update `_SELECTORS` in `connectors/lexuz.py` |
| Scanned PDFs extract nothing | Tesseract language packs missing | Install `tesseract-ocr-uzb` and `-rus` (already in the Dockerfile) |
| SSE arrives all at once | Proxy buffering | Disable `proxy_buffering` for `/api/` |
| Worker OOM | Each worker loads the model | Lower `--concurrency`, or raise the memory limit |
| `budget_tokens` / `temperature` 400 from Anthropic | Removed on current models | The provider uses adaptive thinking + `effort`; don't re-add them |

---

### Before you run this against production data

- **lex.uz has no documented public API.** The connector prefers a JSON
  endpoint if you have an access agreement with the Ministry of Justice, and
  otherwise falls back to polite HTML scraping. Confirm the terms of use,
  and seek written permission for sustained crawling.
- **The HTML selectors will eventually break.** They're isolated at the top
  of `connectors/lexuz.py`, and a daily `connector_selfcheck_task` alerts you
  when they stop matching — a silent break otherwise degrades to an empty
  corpus, which surfaces as "no sources found" rather than an error.
- **norma.uz is a commercial publisher.** Confirm your licence covers
  derivative indexing. Its content is typed `COMMENTARY` and never presented
  as binding law.
- **Court decisions are not a source of law** in Uzbekistan's civil-law
  system. They're indexed for interpretation only and rendered with a
  non-binding marker.
