"""Legal synonym expansion.

Motivated by a measured failure: Labour Code art. 160 ranks 1st when the
question uses *xodim*, the statute's own word, and does not appear in the top 20
when the same question uses *ishchi*, the word an ordinary person uses. Neither
transliteration nor the multilingual embedding bridged it.

The risk being managed here is the opposite one. In a tool whose claim is that
it cites the governing provision, grouping terms a lawyer distinguishes is worse
than missing a result, so several tests below pin down what must *not* be
treated as equivalent.
