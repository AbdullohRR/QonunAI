"""Legal synonym expansion for the lexical retrieval branches.

People do not ask questions in statutory vocabulary. The Labour Code says
*xodim*; someone describing their own situation says *ishchi*. Both mean
"employee", but nothing lexical connects them, and the multilingual embedding
does not reliably bridge them either — measured: the same article (Labour Code
160) ranks 1st when asked with *xodim* and does not appear in the top 20 when
asked with *ishchi*.

**Deliberately conservative.** Every group here is a true equivalence in legal
usage, not a near-relation. Conflating terms that a lawyer distinguishes is a
correctness bug in a tool whose whole claim is that it cites the governing
provision: *shartnoma* (contract) and *bitim* (transaction) overlap in ordinary
speech and are distinct in the Civil Code, so they are not grouped here. When
in doubt, leave it out — a miss is recoverable by rephrasing, a confidently
wrong citation is not.

Applied only to the sparse and article-title branches, which match on tokens.
The dense branch embeds the question as asked; padding that text with synonyms
would move the query vector away from what the user actually wrote.
